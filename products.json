      "Gift for friend out of State. She loves it. Perfect No problems at all!",
      "I didn't get to see it since I mailed it direct as a gift to my bestie. I took off one star because I could not figure out how to include a gift message when shipping it. That would be a lovely feature to include (or make easier to locate if it already is offered.) Also, I was notified it was delivered ten days after it had been, so that was annoying as well. But she liked the item and sent a pic of herself wearing it. So overall, I'm happy."
